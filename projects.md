#### Electron-phonon coupled effective Hamiltonians derived using correlated many-body wave function methods

In some low dimensional meterials, interaction with the collective motion of the atoms leads to a type of ground state called charge density wave, where certain distortions of the lattice are allowed upon lowering temperature.
Bulk 1T-TiSe<sub>2</sub> shows a 2X2 CDW transition at around 232 K, and a 2X2X2 transition at around 205 K. 
Several scenarios have been proposed to explain the origin of the CDW formation: the band Jahn-Teller effect, strong electron-phonon coupling, exciton insulator formed by exciton condensate, and a collaboration between exciton condensation and electron-phonon coupling.
To our knowledge, no first-principles study that is focused on the effect of electron-phonon coupling in 1T-TiSe<sub>2</sub> has ever been reported.
Besides, the cooperation of exciton formation and electron-phonon coupling has not been covered on the level of highly accurate first-principles studies. 
How the energy drop is contributed by electron-phonon coupling and exciton condensation remains quantitatively undetermined.

With density-matrix downfolding method based on quantum Monte Carlo calculations, we can derive a model Hamiltonian for 1T-TiSe<sub>2</sub>, both normal and CDW phases.
This enables us to disentangle the multiple mechanisms underlying the formation of CDW, by attributing the energy drop to the corresponding terms in the Hamiltonian.
